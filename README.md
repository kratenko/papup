# PapUp
Backup files on paper.

PapUp is a project, that aims at creating a well defined standard for 
printing files on one ore multiple sheets of paper, and reading them 
back into a computer. A reference implementation in python using open
software is part of the project.

File printouts are meant as secure long time storage for small to medium 
files. No specialised equipment is necessary to read the data back in, only
a scanner or a similar optical input device. Devices of that nature are 
likely to exist 50 years from now. Keeping the knowledge of how to read 
the printouts alive for such a long period of time is a hard challenge. 
Any proprietary piece of software trying to achieve this seems doomed to 
get lost in oblivion within the first decade or two. Only an open standard
that defines the method printing distinctly and without unclarity can 
hope to survive that long a time.

This is still in a very basic state and to be a prove of concept. Hence, 
no license has been selected, yet, since I'm not sure about all the 
implications of the different licenses.
